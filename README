SimpleToDoApp
==============
Meets all the requirements for the Simple ToDo app project specified.

Completed features:
------------------
* Adding a ToDo Item.
* Deleting a ToDo Item with Long click.
* Editing a ToDo Item with Click.
* Edited ToDo Item wil be stored in the datastore.

In addition I introduced the following features
-----------------------------------------------
* Uses a SQLite Database instead of the filesystem to save the To Do List items.
* ToDoItem is made into a Parcelable javabean so that it is more efficient to pass them as Intent extras
* ToDoItem has attribtues like status, priority and eta (Only the itemText is saved to the database for now, 
  but database has columns to store other these attribtues)
